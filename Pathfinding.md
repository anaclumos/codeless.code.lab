# How many the shortest ways are there?

Keywords: `Taxicab Geometry`, `Analytical Programming`, `Procedural Thinking`

## Overview

Students will develop algorithmic thinking skills to move rabbits from one side to another side of the city. Students will then learn how many different ways exist to move in the shortest way.

## Purpose

In this course, students will develop logical thinking skills and understand a slight preview of discrete mathematics. This course does not require any computer equipment, so therefore students have no burden understanding the computer programming languages.

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Translate movements into a series of commands.
* Count the shortest ways.
* Understand how shortest way exists.

## Teaching Guide

### Warm up (3 minutes)

#### Display

* Show students the picture of the city map.

|Rabbit|------|------|------|------|------|
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|------|------|------|------|------|Carrot|

* Explain the rules. 
   * The rabbit wants to get the carrot.
   * The rabbit can move to any block on right, left, upside, downside of the current block.
   * How should the rabbit move?

### Discuss (3 minutes)

How many combinations can the rabbit get the carrot? It can be a zig-zag shape, or it can be a curly shape. Find as much as combinations you can!

#### After the students find some answers,

* Now let's see how long is that path.
* Count the movement of the rabbit. How long is the journey?
* What is the longest, and what is the shortest path?

### Main Activity (5 minutes)

* Find the most efficient way to get the carrot! How long is the path?
* List several ways of the shortest path
* How many "move right," "move downward" "move left" "move upward" are there?
* Is there any common properties?

> Teacher's guide

> For any given combination, the shortest path only consist of 5 "move right"s and 3 "move downward"s. According to the arrangement, each different path is born.

### Presentation (2 minutes)

* Give students to present their findings.
* Acknowlege that there only combinations of 5 "move right"s and 3 "move downward"s.

### Wrap up (2 minutes)
* Common distance have only one shortest path (straight line)
* This case considers a Taxicab geometry, which is not "Euclidean." (Don't delve deep in this topic)
* Computers use these procedural technologies to find the shortest path, just as we did.
